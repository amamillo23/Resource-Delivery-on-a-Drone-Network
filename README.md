# Resource-Delivery-on-a-Drone-Network
A Python project implementing a custom Drone Delivery Problem to demonstrate AI search algorithms. Includes Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* search to find optimal delivery paths, with comparison of efficiency, completeness, and node expansion. Designed for learning and experimenting with uninformed vs informed search strategies.
